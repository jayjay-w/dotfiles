# tmux Configuration

Config files for tmux

## Installation
Install the config files according to the instructions in this repo's top level README.md

## Color Customization
If you want to experiment with custom colors in your tmux setup, running `./tmux_colors.sh` will list you the names and the look of all colors that are available for you.

Out of the box, this tmux configuration will stick to the first few colors defined in your color space. This should make it easy to switch color schemes in your terminal without having to do any further work in your tmux config.
